# About This Site

I have been programming for nearly 40 years.  My first computer was an Atari 400 that my parents purchased from a local
computer store. While the family was happy sticking cartridges in to play games, my imagination was captured by 
controlling the computer to make my own games.  

I started learning Atari BASIC to make my earliest games but quickly learned 6502 Assembler for performance.  
Over the years, I kept learning more and more computer languages.   I turned my passion for programming into a 
professional career as an enterprise software engineer.  I consider myself lucky to love what I do for a living.

However, my passion for programming games never subsided.  My passion the web has only continued to grow over the last 30
years.  The promise of the modern day web has never been exciting - awesome web-browsers, improving standards, and
great communities continue to fuel innovation and imagination.

This website is about allowing me to share my journey of Phaser programming with others.  In the process, I hope to 
become a better Phaser game developer, and I hope to improve my writing skills.   

I sincerely hope that this website can contribute to the wonderful online community and hopefully inspire someone
to pursue game programming!
